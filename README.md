### TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES:
-DATA PREPARATION
# DATA CLEANING:
THE GIVEN DATA WAS CLEAN WITH PROPER DATA TYPE, NO DUPLICATES OR NULL CELLS.
# DATA COMBINING:
IN HR 1 AND HR 2 DATA SHEETS WE HAVE FOUND A COMMON COLUMN NAMELY EMPLOYEE ID.
FIRSTLY, WE SORTED THE EMPLOYEE ID COLUMN EXPANDING THE SELECTION IN ASCENDING ORDER,
AND THEN WE MERGED BOTH THE SHEETS USING POWER QUERY EDITOR TAKING OF EMPLOYEE ID IN HR 2 AND EMPLOYEE NUMBER IN HR 1.

### INSIGHTS
### 1st KPI.AVERAGE ATTRITION RATE FOR ALL DEPARTMENT
- In all department attrition rates are relatively high i.e., over 8% indicating a significant level of employee turnover.
- this suggest underlying issues that need tp be addressed such as job satisfaction,work culture or competative compensation.
- from chart we can see that the R&D has the highest attrition rate i.e.,8.52% indicating potential dissatisfaction with job condition, presssure or incentives.and hardware department has the lowest attrition rate i.e., 8.08% suggesting relatively better employee satisfaction,though the difference isnot very large,so continual improvement can still be valuable.

### 2nd KPI.AVERAGE HOURLY RATE OF MALE RESEARCH SCIENTIST
- Here we can see the hourly rate for the male research scientists is around 114$ which is 4.96%.while for females, it is around 115$ which is 5.02%.
-  This indicates female research scientists are earning slightly more than their male counterparts.

### 3rd KPI.ATTRITION RATE VS MONTHLY INCOME STATS
- The total attrition rate is 50.21% is quite high.indicating significant employee turnover across the company which requires immediate attention.
- we can see there is no major difference inattrition across income levels indicating the income alone may not be the primary factor for attrition.
- here the middle range also shows significant attrition.which suggest dissatisfaction might not be related to career progression,work environment/leadership.
- the employees in the high salaries range are also leaving the company so the retention stratergies need to be focused more than just compensation.non-monetory factors like employee engagement, developement and work life balance.

### 4th KPI.AVERAGE WORKING YEARS FOR EACH DEPARTMENT
- all department shows average working years ranging over 20years.
- in which the software department has the highest average working year at 20.645yrs(17%).
- the HR and R&D have the lower average working years that are 20.454 yrs(16%) and 20.298yrs(16%) respectively.

### 5th KPI.JOB ROLE VS WORKLIFE BALANCE 
- there is a noticeable variation in worklife balance across different roles.
- by considering overall chart and ranking them based on the work life balance we can say that the sales Ececutive, healthcare representative and manager are the top 3 roles whose work life is balanced due to job satisfaction.
- the lab technician and HR are ranked least indicating potential issues such as job satisfaction,worklife balance.

### 6th KPI.ATTRITION RATE VS YRS SINCE LAST PROMOTION
- in first category(1-10yrs): This category has the highest attrition rate with 41.44% employees.which indicates that the majority of employees who have not been promoted in last 1-10yrs are leaving company.
this suggest that the lack of early career progression could be a significant drive of attriton.
- in second category(11020yrs): in this category the attrition rate is around 6.86% which is significantly low
also in last category (31-40yrs): there are only 0.23% employees fall into it with low attrition rate.indicating these employees have high level of commitment to the company.
it may be due to nearing of retirement or being in a stable or long term role.
